All files in /content/shorts (global path) are unreachable for me:
content/shorts/underwater.swf
content/shorts/squidzoid.swf
content/shorts/penguinsTime.swf
content/shorts/fairyFables.swf
content/shorts/ruby.swf
content/shorts/goldenPuffle.swf


Rest of files in global crumbs are being worked on, and local are for later.
